# Mollusque

Open source content-management-y API platform

## Installation

Just clone the repo.

## Setup

Mollusque depends on the following:

* Ruby 2.x and 1.9.3
* PostgresSQL
* [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/)
* [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) for configuration

Setup should be fairly standard and obvious. I'll update this if anything strange
or custom pops up.

# Mollusque [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rsl/mollusque.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rsl/mollusque) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rsl/mollusque.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rsl/mollusque)

Open source content-management-y API platform

## Installation

Just clone the repo.

## Setup

Mollusque depends on the following:

* Ruby 2.1.2, though it most likely works for anything back to 1.9.3. I just don't have Travis builds for them all out of niceness.
* PostgresSQL
* [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/)
* [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) for configuration

Setup should be fairly standard and obvious. I'll update this if anything strange
or custom pops up.
